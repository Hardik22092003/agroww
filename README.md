# Agroww 🌱

**Agroww** is a cutting-edge **farming investment platform** designed to bridge the gap between investors and agriculture. It enables users to invest in agricultural farms based on **shares**, and earn profits once the produce is sold. This model empowers both farmers and investors — bringing transparency, opportunity, and sustainability to the agri-investment ecosystem.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Investment by Shares**: Investors can invest in farms by purchasing shares, each representing a portion of the farm's production.
- 💰 **Profit Distribution**: Once the produce is sold, profits are calculated and distributed based on shareholding.
- 🌾 **Farm Management**: Real-time data on farm activities, investments, and expected returns.
- 🧾 **Transaction History**: View past investments and profit summaries.
- 🔐 **Secure Authentication**: Investor access is secured and authenticated.
